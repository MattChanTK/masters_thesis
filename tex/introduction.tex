% The context is interactive arts sculpture made by PBAI
Interactive arts are a type of art form that requires the involvement of the spectators to achieve its purpose. With recent advances in capabilities and miniaturization of computers, sensors and actuators, artists now have access to more tools to create highly complex interactive artworks. In the Hylozoic Series of kinetic sculptures built by Philip Beesley Architect Inc.(PBAI)\footnote{Philip Beesley Architect Inc.: \url{http://philipbeesleyarchitect.com}}, the designers use a network of microcontrollers to control and sample hundreds of actuators and sensors \cite{Beesley2010}\cite{Beesley2010-1}. Each node in the network can perform a simple set of interactive behaviours. While the behaviours have previously been either prescripted or random, complex group behaviours have been seen to emerge through the communication among nodes and interaction with the spectators \cite{Beesley2012}. 

Nevertheless, the behaviours of the sculptural system is still manually designed by its designers. In addition, its interactive behaviours remain unchanged over time. To truly take on the characteristics of a living system, the sculptural system should have the ability to generate its own behaviours. Its interactive behaviours should morph over time and adapt to changes in external environment. To accomplish this, we introduced the Curiosity-Based Learning Algorithm (CBLA) to the Hylozoic series installation. The CBLA re-casts the interactive sculpture as a set of agents driven by an intrinsic desire to learn. Presented with a set of input and output variables that it can observe and control, each agent tries to understand its own mechanisms, its surrounding environment, and the occupants, by learning models relating its inputs and outputs. We hypothesize that the occupants will find the behaviours which emerge during CBLA-based control to be interesting, more life-like, and less robotic. 

Moreover, this approach reduces the reliance on humans to manually design interesting and life-like behaviours. In systems with large numbers of sensors and actuators, programming a complex set of carefully choreographed behaviours is complicated and requires lengthy implementation and testing processes. Furthermore, this approach allows the sculpture to adapt and change its behaviour over time. This is especially interesting for permanent installations in which the same users may interact with the sculpture over an extended period of time. 

% What are we doing in this work
In this thesis, we examined the physical manifestation of a learning algorithm in an abstract interactive art sculpture. Working with PBAI, a new series of interactive sculptures was designed and built to generate its own behaviours through learning and interaction with its physical environment. We observed how occupants of the space responds and perceive the behaviours of the sculpture. 

\section{Projects Components}

This project can be broken down into three main components. The first component is the Curiosity-Based Learning Algorithm. The second component is the hardware and software systems required to support the algorithm. The third component is an user experience study that allows us to investigate how the sculptural system responds to interaction with human users and how human users appraise the behaviours emerged from this learning system. 

Oudeyer et al. developed the Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity (IAC) \cite{Oudeyer2007}, a reinforcement learning algorithm with the objective of maximizing learning progress. In his experiments, he showed that an agent would tend to explore state-space that is neither too predictable nor too random, mimicking the intrinsic human drive of curiosity, which continually tries to explore areas that have the highest potential for learning new knowledge. The learning mechanism developed for this thesis built on Oudeyer's IAC and applied it on an architectural-scale distributed interactive sculptural system. We called it Curiosity-Based Learning Algorithm (CBLA). A CBLA system is comprised of a network of asynchronous learning agents that are linked virtually and physically. The asynchronous nature of the system allows learning agents controlling actuators with different operating bandwidths to coexist. Meanwhile, the links among the different learning agents enable information to travel within the system, allowing distributed learning.

Compared to previous generations of control hardware and software, a CBLA system requires greatly increased number of sensors and computational power. To maintain a responsive control cycle time, a drastic increase in communication rates also was required. Hence, a new series of electronic hardware and communication architecture with enhanced sensing and communication capabilities was developed to bring CBLA to the Hylozoic Series interactive art sculpture. 

Furthermore, to better understand users' response and perception of this learning behaviours, it is important to be able to capture their responses as they are interacting with the sculpture. An experimental test bed running CBLA was therefore constructed and users were invited to interact with the sculpture. Through this user study, we examined how users respond to the behaviours of the CBLA system. In particular, the relationship between the behaviours of the sculptural system and the level of interest as reported by the users was investigated. 

\section{Contributions}

First, this thesis presents an adaptation of learning algorithm which was previously used on developmental robotics in an interactive arts. In \cite{Oudeyer2007}, the state space of the robot was relatively small. However, in our case, there is an order of magnitude more input and output variables. In order to make learning such a large distributed system manageable, a network of multiple learning agents was made to run simultaneously, each capturing a specific set of sensors and actuators. 

Second, unlike many reinforcement learning problems, acquiring a model of the learning targets as quickly and accurately as possible isn't our main objective. Instead we want to study the learning process itself and study how curiosity affects the way that the system explores the state-space. The behaviour of the interactive art sculptures is a physical manifestation of the learning process. An additional mechanism that alters the actions of system based on knowledge gain potential is introduced. This gives the users a visual indication of the state of learning agents. In a way, this ties the users into the learning process and complex behaviours emerge automatically though these interactions. This emergent behaviours was observed and analyzed in this thesis.

Third, the user study conducted allows us to examine how human occupants interact and perceive the behaviours of the sculpture. We analyzed the relationships between the behaviours of the system and the users. From there, we began to understand what interests people and how different activation patterns might lead to different responses. 


\section{Organization}

In \Cref{chap:related_work}, related work in interactive arts, artificial life, developmental robotics, machine learning and user experience sampling would be examined and discussed. In \Cref{chap:cbla}, the working of our implementation of the Curiosity-Based Learning algorithm would be thoroughly described. A new electronic control system was designed and built from ground up in order to incorporate the large number of sensors and actuators and to run the CBLA. The design and implementation of hardware and software of this system are presented in \Cref{chap:ctrl_system}. Then, we observed the behaviours of the sculptural system running the CBLA system under different configurations and examined its interactions with the users. The methodologies and findings of the experiments are presented in \Cref{chap:validations}. Finally, the conclusions as well as ideas for future work are presented in \Cref{chap:conclusions}.
