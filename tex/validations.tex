\chapter{Validations} \label{chap:validations}

In this chapter, we demonstrate the behaviours emerged from running Curiosity-Based Learning Algorithm (CBLA) on an interactive art sculpture. We first investigated the behaviour of the simplest form of a CBLA system, one with a single node with one sensor and one actuator. This allows us to visualize the exploration pattern of the CBLA engine in two- or three-dimensional space. Then, we applied the algorithm on a small multi-node system with shared input variables. We observed its self-learning behaviours as well as the way it responds to external disturbances. After that, we constructed a small scale interactive sculptural system in the form of four-clusters test bed. In additional to shared inputs, virtual inputs were introduced to connect the different nodes. We investigated on the different emergent behaviours as results of different connection schemes. Finally, we conducted a formal user study using the test bed. Participants were invited to interact with the sculpture and report on their interest levels. The observations collected in this user study enabled us to understand the relationship between the participants' behaviours and engagement level under different conditions as well as different configurations of the CBLA system.

\section[Single Node Experiment]
{Single Node Experiment
	\footnote{An early version of this chapter has been submitted to IROS 2015 \cite{Chan2015} }}\label{sec:single-node}

Although the CBLA was designed for a distributed system with multiple nodes, it might not be easy to visualize the modelling process due to the high-dimensionality of the data and the models. To demonstrate the action selection pattern and the learning process, the CBLA was first tested on a simple toy example which is easily visualizable in 3-dimensional space. In this experiment, idle mode was disabled as the main objective was to observe and verify the exploration pattern of the CBLA. 

\subsection{Set-up}
The system in this experiment consists of a Light node, which is a single-input, single-output system. For the single-input system, S is a scalar value that represents the measurement from an ambient light sensor. It was recorded directly as a 12-bit value. M corresponds to the voltage duty cycle supplied to the LED, ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 being completely off (0V) and 100 being the maximum allowable voltage (~4.7V). The loop period is the time between each actuation and was set to 0.05s.

\subsection{Procedures and Expected Results}
In this experiment, the system ran for 2500 time steps without any external interference. 
Based on the reward structure, which favours learning first the most predictable regions of the state-space, the CBLA is expected to first explore the regions of the sensorimotor space that have low variance. Once the model in that region is learnt, it should move onto areas with higher variance.

\subsection{Results}

\Cref{fig:LED_ALS Model Evolution} shows the evolution of the prediction model and actual exemplars over time. As expected, the CBLA first selects actions associated with lower LED output levels, as this leads to measurements in the low variance regions. Over time, once the model in the low variance region is acquired, it moves toward higher brightness regions. \Cref{fig:LED_ALS Action Selection} shows that the best action and the actual selected action were completely random at first. The system then focused on the easy-to-learn areas in the lower brightness level. After that, it moved toward the higher brightness and harder-to-learn regions when it hadn't seen much improvement in the low brightness regions. After some exploration of the bright regions, prediction error is reduced in those regions, and the system returns again to explore the low-brightness region.  The resulting pattern of activation is interesting visually, as it results in non-random activations that have the potential to convey a notion of intent to the viewer.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:LED_ALS Mean Error vs Time} shows the mean error vs. time graph. Here we see that the prediction error quickly drops to a relatively low level. To improve its prediction further, the state-space was split into regions with low and high error. This allows the Region 1 (low variance region) to further reduce its prediction error.

\end{figure}


In \Cref{fig:LED_ALS Action Value vs Time}, one can that see the action value of a region does not stay constant. This shows that as the prediction improves, the value of actions in that region decreases over time as the region becomes “learnt” and further learning potential decreases.

\section[Multi-Node Experiment]
{Multi-Node Experiment
	\footnote{An early version of this chapter has been submitted to IROS 2015 \cite{Chan2015} }}\label{sec:multi-node}


In this Section, we describe a demonstration of an integrated system consisting of multiple CBLA Nodes. In addition, in this experiment, threshold-based Idle Mode was introduced. When the knowledge gain potential is low, a Node would enter Idle Mode and turn off its actuators. The behaviours of the system during self learning period and its response to external interference was examined.

\subsection{Set-up}
The Light node was the same as in \Cref{sec:single-node}, with the addition of the shared IR proximity sensor. For the Fin node, the input variables are the average accelerometer readings of the three axes, and the shared IR proximity sensor reading over the 12.5s loop period; the output variable is the action of the Fin. There are four discrete actions: rest (0), lower to the right (1), lower to the left (2), and lower to the centre (3). Note that in this set up, the two types of nodes run with different loop periods, but coupling between them is accomplished through the shared IR sensor, which measures proximity as a 12-bit value. Note that in this experiment all four nodes share one single IR sensor. The set-up of the experiment is shown in \Cref{fig:Single_Cluster Set-up}.

\begin{figure} [!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[height=0.8\textheight]{"fig/validations/Single_Cluster Set-up"}
	\caption[Photograph of the Multi-Node Experiment set-up]{The set-up of the Multi-Node Experiment. The Light Node is shaded light blue, and the three Fin Nodes are shaded red, blue, and yellow. All four nodes share an IR proximity sensor in the purple circle.}
	\label{fig:Single_Cluster Set-up}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Procedures and Expected Results}
The system runs undisturbed until, after some initial learning, all of the nodes enter Idle Mode.  During this time, the IR proximity sensor pointed toward an empty area. Afterwards, a participant enters into the sculpture space in an area detectable by the IR proximity sensor. The system should then exit idle mode and begin learning the changed model introduced by the change in the environment.  Since the IR sensor is shared by all nodes, they are all expected to recognize the change and exit idle mode at approximately the same time. 

\subsection{Results}

\Cref{fig:Single_Cluster Action Value Vs Time} shows how the action values change over time for each of the nodes. The coloured lines represent the action values and each colour represents a region. The blue dots underneath the plot indicate when the node was in idle mode.

\begin{figure} [!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{"fig/validations/Single_Cluster Action Value Vs Time"}
	\caption[Action value vs time graph for the Single Cluster Experiment]{Action-value vs Time graph for the Light node (a) and the three Fin nodes (b), (c), (d).}
	\label{fig:Single_Cluster Action Value Vs Time}
\end{figure}

All the nodes first started learning their own models and entered idle mode. At around 390s, a human participant walked in front of the IR proximity sensor. This triggered a large reduction in action value at first, due to an increase in prediction error. However, as more data was collected, the action values for all four nodes quickly jumped up. This prompted the nodes to exit idle mode and begin generating actions to learn the model. After a period of readjustment, all four nodes re-entered idle mode after the new environment is learnt. 

\subsection{Discussions}

From \Cref{fig:Single_Cluster Action Value Vs Time}, one can see that the Light Node and the three Fin Nodes reacted to the environmental change nearly simultaneously. They exited the idle state and shifted to more exploratory actuation patterns. This showed that the shared sensor input variable was able link the CBLA engines together, even though they run independently at different frequencies. This experiment demonstrates that the reaction of the system to the changed environmental conditions creates an interaction with the visitor without any explicitly pre-programmed behaviours. The system appears to respond to the participant and their action, as its internal model of the environment cannot predict the behaviour of the participant. 

The system's intrinsic curiosity drives itself to perform actions and elicit responses from this new environment with the participant's presence, and update its prediction model. We anticipate that the visitors will find such behaviours engaging as the visitors can recognize that the sculpture is responding to their presence and action but they would not be able to easily predict how it might respond. This quality provides the CBLA System the potential to be more life-like than a prescripted or a random system. 


\section{Multi-Cluster Test Bed}\label{sec:multi-cluster-test-bed}

An experimental test bed was built to investigate how user interact with the a CBLA system. This is a small scale four-cluster test bed that resembles a typical interactive sculpture produced by the Philip Beesley Architect Inc. (PBAI) and it was used in the experiments described in \Cref{sec:multi-cluster-experiment,sec:user-study}. A photograph of the complete test bed is shown in \Cref{fig:cbla-test-bed photo 2}

	\label{fig:cbla-test-bed photo 2}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Electronic Components}

A Light Unit is made up of one high-power LED and one ambient light sensor. The high-power LED is mounted on top of a flask containing coloured liquid. The ambient light sensor is mounted on the side of the flask under the LED. This allows the ambient light sensor to measure the intensity of the light emitted by the LED. 

A Fin Unit is made up of two SMA wires, a pair of LED, a vibration motor, a 3-axis accelerometer, and two IR proximity sensors. The two SMA wires pull on two levers that move a Fin, which is a mechanism made of soft plastic rods that curls up. An IR proximity sensor and an accelerometer are mounted at around midway between the tip to the root of the Fin. At the bottom of the Fin, a vibration motor, a pair of LEDs, and an IR proximity sensor is mounted in the middle of two frond-like objects. 

\subsection{Device Nodes}

Device Nodes further abstract the Output and Input Nodes to enable higher level functionality. This frees the CBLA Nodes from managing the constraints imposed by the physical attributes of the actuators and sensors. 

\subsubsection{SMA Controller Node}

In the experiment described in \Cref{sec:multi-node}, the SMA wires were only operated in fully-off or fully-on mode. This means that a Fin with two SMA wires can only have four possibles states. In addition, each actuation must be a cycle since the SMA wires cannot be fully actuated at 5V for more than 2 seconds. Empirically, we determined that the cooling period takes around 10 seconds. This means that the loop period for a CBLA Node cannot be lower than 12 seconds since it does not have the freedom to actuate the SMA wires again during the cooling period. These restrictions are problematics during interaction with the users since the learning period and response latency would likely take longer than what a typical visitor would spend in front of a section of a sculpture. In addition, only a very coarse model can be made with only four possible actions that the Fin can choose from. This means that the Fin Node would likely be very unresponsive since the variance in resultant state for each kind of action is likely to be very high.

Thus, for this experiment, a position controller Node is needed to enable the SMA wire to hold its contraction while keeping the SMA wire at a safe temperature. Since the length of an SMA wire is related to the temperature, and current are passed through the SMA wire to generate the heat, to maintain a position, the controller needs to adjust the output voltage to a level that can maintain the desired temperature. This can reduce the loop period as the SMA wires no longer need to cool down after actuating. In addition, the number of actions is no longer limited to four as the Node can select any value between fully-off and fully-on. However, it is difficult to attach a temperature sensor on the SMA wire. Thus, instead of using a feedback controller, only an open-loop controller with a model that estimates the temperature of an SMA wire is used.

This controller essentially produces a control signal that allows the SMA wire to quickly reaches its desired temperature by setting the output voltage very high. It then gradually lowers the voltage as the SMA wire reaches its desired position according to an internal model. Development of this model starts with the intuition that the temperature of the wire increases when the rate of heating is greater than the rate of cooling. The rate of heating is related to the voltage across the wire. On the other hand, the rate of cooling is related to the temperature of the wire since it is mainly driven by the wire's own natural convection. 

We first calculate the heat transfer rate as a result of current passing through the SMA wire. According to Joule's Law of Heating \cite{JouleHeating},
\begin{equation}
	H = \frac{1}{J}i^2 \cdot r \cdot t
\end{equation}
where $H$ is heat generated in joule (J); $J$ is a constant known as the Joule's mechanical equivalent of heat; $i$ is the current in ampere (A); $r$ is the resistance of the wire in ohm; and $t$ is time is second.

We can simplify the equation by lumping $\frac{1}{J}\cdot r$ together and treating it as one constant $k_{heating}$
In our case, although $r$ is not actually a constant since the resistance of the SMA wire decreases as it shortens~\cite{FlexinolTechSpecs}, the effect is sufficiently small that we can ignore. Therefore, we get,

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:simple-joule-heating}
H = k_{heating} \cdot i^2 \cdot t
\end{equation}

Taking the derivative of \eqref{eqn:simple-joule-heating}, we can get the heat transfer rate, $q$, in watt (W) due to the electrical current at $i$ amperes. 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:heating-rate-i}
	q_1 = \frac{dH}{dt} = k_{heating} \cdot i^2
\end{equation}
where $q_1$ is the heat transfer rate in watt (W).

According to Ohm's Law, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:ohm's law}
	i = \frac{v}{r}
\end{equation}
where $i$ is the current in ampere; $v$ is the voltage in volt (V); and $r$ is resistance in ohm.

Substituting \eqref{eqn:ohm's law} into \eqref{eqn:heating-rate-i}, we get

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:heating-rate-v}
q_1 = k_{heating} \cdot v^2
\end{equation}

Since our control signal, $x$, is proportional to the voltage, it can simply be absorbed into the $k_{heating}$ constant as 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:heating-rate-x}
q_1 = k_{heating} \cdot x^2
\end{equation}

Then, we calculate the heat loss rate due to natural convection of the SMA wire. According to the Newton's Law of Cooling~\cite{NewtonLawOfCooling}, 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cooling-newton-law}
q_2 = h_c \cdot A \cdot dT
\end{equation}
where $q_2$ is the heat transfer rate in watt ($W$); $h_c$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient; A is the area of the heat transfer surface in $m^2$; and $dT$ is the temperature difference between the air and the surface in Kelvin ($K$).

If we approximate $h_c$, $A$, and the air temperature $T_{air}$ as constant, we get
\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:cooling-newton-law-simple}
	\begin{flalign}
		q_2 &= k_{cooling} \cdot (T - T_{air}) \\
			&= k_{cooling} \cdot T - k_{cooling} \cdot T_{air} \\
			&= k_{cooling} \cdot T + k_{air}\label{eqn:cooling-newton-law-simple-end}
	\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}
where $q_2$ is the heat transfer rate in Watt ($W$); $k_{cooling}$ and $k_{air}$ are constants; and $T$ is the temperature of the SMA wire in Kelvin ($K$).

Combining \eqref{eqn:heating-rate-x} and \eqref{eqn:cooling-newton-law-simple-end}, we get the total heat transfer rate as 
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{flalign}
		q &= q_1 - q_2 \\
		  &= k_{heating} \cdot x^2 - k_{cooling} \cdot T + k_{air}\label{eqn:total_heat}
	\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}

We can then calculate the kinetic energy generated during time interval $\Delta t$ by multiplying \eqref{eqn:total_heat} by $\Delta t$.
\begin{equation}
	KE =  (k_{heating} \cdot x^2 - k_{cooling} \cdot T + k_{air}) \cdot \Delta t \label{eqn:total_KE}
\end{equation}

Since temperature is directly proportional to kinetic energy, the proportionality constant can be absorbed into $k_{heating}$, $k_{cooling}$, and $ k_{air}$ as well. 
\begin{equation}
	\Delta T =  (k_{heating} \cdot x^2 - k_{cooling} \cdot T  + k_{air}) \cdot \Delta t\label{eqn:delta_T}
\end{equation}

At each time step, $\Delta t$, the temperature is incremented by $\Delta T$.  
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{flalign}
	T_{t+1} &=  T_{t} + \Delta T \\
		    &=  T_{t} + k_{heating} \cdot x^2 - k_{cooling} \cdot T_{t}  + k_{air}\label{eqn:sma-controller-model}
	\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}

In this formulation, the actual unit of the temperature is not important. Instead, we define 0 as the temperature when the SMA wire is the longest and 1 when the SMA wire is the shortest. The steady-state temperature of the SMA wire should be 0 when the input, $x$, is 0. If we substitute 0 into $T_{t+1}$, $T_{t}$, and $x$ into \eqref{eqn:sma-controller-model}, we get $k_{air} = 0$. 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:sma-controller-model-1}
T_{t+1} =  T_{t} + k_{heating} \cdot x^2 - k_{cooling} \cdot T_{t}
\end{equation}

From the SMA wire's technical specifications\cite{FlexinolTechSpecs}, we identify the maximum current that the SMA wire can operate continuously without heat damage. Using that value, we determine the maximum continuous output level, $x_c$. This means that when the desired temperature, $T$, is equal to 1, at steady-state, $x$ should be at $x_c$. This means, 
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{flalign}
	 0 &= k_{heating} \cdot x_c^2 - k_{cooling} \\
	 k_{cooling} &=  k_{heating} \cdot x_c^2\label{eqn:k_cooling}
	\end{flalign}
\end{subequations}

The SMA wires would not be damaged due to over-heating as long as the relationship in \eqref{eqn:k_cooling} holds. In fact, we can set $k_{heating}$ to 1 arbitrarily to simplify \eqref{eqn:sma-controller-model-1} further. At the end, we get
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:sma-controller-model-2}
	T_{t+1} =  T_{t} + x^2 -  x_c^2 \cdot T_{t}
\end{equation}
as the temperature model for the SMA Controller Node.

We then apply and tune a PI controller on this temperature model to track a desired temperature as shown in \Cref{fig:SMA Controller}. A Node can specifies a desired temperature, $T_{desired}$, between 0 and 1 and the SMA Controller tracks this temperature within its internal temperature model. The control signal generated by this PI Controller is applied to the actual SMA wire in parallel. 

\begin{figure} [htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{"fig/validations/SMA Controller"}
	\caption[Block diagram of the SMA Controller]{Block diagram of the SMA Controller. }
	\label{fig:SMA Controller}
\end{figure}

Due to the lack of feedback control and the simplifications and approximations made when developing the model, the accuracy of this controller is relatively low. However, the main purpose of this SMA Controller is to enable the CBLA Node to hold the Fin at a particular position. As a result, this allows the CBLA Engine to run at a higher rate and expands its number of possible actions. 


\subsubsection{LED Driver Node}

If a CBLA Node controls an LED directly, any change in brightness would be set instantly. As a result, the LED may appear to be flicking or flashing erratically to the viewers as it rapidly jumps between different brightness levels. To improve the aesthetic, an LED Driver that brightens and dims the LED gradually is introduce. However, the relationship between brightness level of a typical LED and the input voltage is non-linear \cite{CreeLEDDatasheet}. At low voltage levels, the brightness increases rapidly as input voltage increases. At higher voltage levels, a larger increase in voltage is needed to increase the brightness at the same rate. In order for the change in brightness to appear more linear, \eqref{eqn:led-driver discrete update} is used to update the output level of an LED. 

At every time step, 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:led-driver discrete update}
	x_{t+1} =
	\begin{cases}
		0.00001 & \text{if } x_{t} == 0 \text{ and }  x_{desired} > 0 \\
		x_{t} + k \cdot x_{t}, & \text{if } x_{t} < x_{desired} \\
		x_{t} - k \cdot x_{t}, & \text{if } x_{t} > x_{desired} \\
		x_{t}, & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases} 
\end{equation}
where $x_{t+1}$ is the output level in the next time step $t+1$; $x_t$ is the current output level at time $t$; $x_{desired}$ is the desired output level; and $k$ is a constant that determines rate of change in brightness. $x_{desired}$ must be between 0 and 1. 

To show that \eqref{eqn:led-driver discrete update} resembles the profile of an LED, its second and third cases are formulated as a first-order ODE. 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:led-driver ODE}
	 \frac{dx(t)}{dt} \pm k \cdot x(t)  = 0
\end{equation}

Solving \eqref{eqn:led-driver ODE}, we get 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:led-driver ODE_solved}
	x(t) = x(0) \cdot e^k \cdot e^{\mp k \cdot t}
\end{equation}
where $x(0)$ is the initial output level when the desired output level is changed.

\eqref{eqn:led-driver ODE_solved} is an exponential function which increases the output level of the LED at a faster rate at higher brightness region. 

\subsection{Isolated CBLA Nodes}\label{sec:isolated-cbla-node}

Each Isolated CBLA Node is associated with one actuator. A CBLA system is constructed by linking these Isolated CBLA Nodes through virtual inputs. In this test bed, three main types of Isolated CBLA Node exists: Half-Fin Node, Light Node, and Reflex Node.
 
\Cref{fig:Isolated CBLA Nodes} presents the make-up of the different Isolated CBLA Nodes in a cluster. Two Half-Fin Nodes control the bending of a Fin through their respective SMA Controller Nodes (Fx.SMA-L and Fx.SMA-R). The pair of Half-Fin Nodes share a Fin-mounted IR proximity sensor (Fx.IR-F), and the 3 axes of the accelerometer (Fx.ACC). A Light Node controls the brightness of a high-power LED through an LED driver Node (Lx.LED) and its sensory space consists of an ambient light sensor (Lx.ALS). There are two types of Reflex Nodes, one is associated with a pair of LEDs (Fx.RFX-L), and one is associated with a vibration motor (Fx.RFX-M). They are both being controlled through LED Driver Nodes. In their sensory space, they share one bottom-mounted IR proximity sensor (Fx.IR-S).

	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{"fig/validations/Isolated CBLA Nodes"}

	\label{fig:Isolated CBLA Nodes}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Network Configurations}

Isolated CBLA Nodes described in \Cref{sec:isolated-cbla-node} are connected to each other via virtual inputs. In essence, the output of a CBLA Node is treated as an input variable to other Nodes, much like input variables associated with their own sensors. This creates a interconnected network of CBLA Nodes that span across the entire sculptural system. This allows information regarding the external environment to travel through the sculpture. 

Different network configurations produce different system behaviours. Here we investigate two types of network configurations which are called Spatial Mode and Random Mode. For fair comparisons, the two configurations have exactly 111 links. In addition, each Node is linked to at least one other Node via virtual input. 

\subsubsection{Spatial Mode}

In Spatial Mode, CBLA Nodes are linked based on their spatial proximity. \Cref{fig:Spatial Local Modes} shows the connections among Nodes within a cluster. Neighbouring Nodes are connected via bidirectional links. Two connected Nodes take each other's output as input variable. Nodes in neighbouring clusters that are in close proximity are linked via unidirectional links as shown in \Cref{fig:Spatial Global Mode}. The circular connections that daisy-chain the four clusters allow information to spread throughout the test bed. 

\begin{figure} [!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{"fig/validations/Spatial Local Mode"}
	\caption[Connectivity graph within a cluster in Spatial Mode]{Connectivity graph within a cluster in Spatial Mode. Each bidirectional green arrow represents a pair of input links. Two connected Nodes take each other's output as input variable. Note that each bidirectional link is counted as two links.}
	\label{fig:Spatial Local Modes}
\end{figure}

	\includegraphics[height=0.85 \textheight]{"fig/validations/Spatial Global Mode"}
	\caption[Connectivity graph of the entire test bed in Spatial Mode]{Connectivity graph of the entire test bed in Spatial Mode. Each blue unidirectional arrow represents an input link. The output of the Node at the origin of an arrow is fed into the Node that it is pointing toward as an input variable.}
	\label{fig:Spatial Global Mode}
\end{figure}

Under this configuration, Nodes' responses to external disturbances or environmental changes are expected to concentrate close to the source, and spread to other Nodes gradually. 

\subsubsection{Random Mode}

In Random Mode, CBLA Nodes are linked to other CBLA Nodes randomly. This means that the output of a Node might be fed into another Node that is on the other side of the sculpture. Since there are 60 Nodes and 111 links are required, the algorithm first links the output of each Node to another random Node to ensure that each Node has an effect in the overall system. Then, the algorithm picks 51 unique Nodes at random and links each of them to another random Node. This ensures that the state space of each Node is relatively even. 

The specific random configuration is generated at run-time and it is different every time. In addition, it should be noted that this method does not guarantee that there would not be any disparate sub-networks. It is possible that a set of Node is completely isolated from another set of Node under this network configuration scheme.

\subsection{Prescripted Behaviours}\label{sec:prescripted-behaviours}

For the purpose of comparing between CBLA and prescripted behaviours, each CBLA Node has a Prescripted Engine in addition to the CBLA Engine. This allows us to quickly switch between the two kinds of behaviours during the user study described in \Cref{sec:user-study}. Although the two engines are both associated with the same actuators, they may have different sensors in its sensory space. 

The overall system behaviour can be described without going into the implementation details of each Prescripted Engine.

For the Fin mechanism, when its Fin-mounted IR proximity sensor detects an object, it bends down toward the direction of a neighbouring bottom-mounted IR proximity sensor that has also detected an object. If both or neither of IR proximity sensors have detected an object, it simply bends straight down. It returns to an upright rest position when its Fin-mounted IR proximity sensor no longer detects an object in its proximity.

For the high-power LEDs, its output ramps up and down continuously when its corresponding Fin-mounted IR proximity sensor has detected an object. It then dims gradually when the object is removed.

For the reflex vibration motor or LED pair, its output also ramps up and down continuously when its corresponding bottom-mounted IR proximity sensor has detected an object. It then ramps down gradually when the object is removed.

An additional virtual node is added to provide cluster-level group behaviours. This node counts the number of outputs within its cluster that are active. It then determines a probability of random activation by mapping this count to a Gaussian function. The Fin mechanism or the high-power LED may turn on at random based on this probability. Using a Gaussian function allows the probability of random activation to increase when a number of outputs are activated. However, when too many outputs are activated, this probability decreases which makes random activations less probable. 


\section{Multi-Cluster Experiment}\label{sec:multi-cluster-experiment}

This experiment investigates the behaviours of the CBLA system on a small scale four-cluster test bed described in \Cref{sec:multi-cluster-test-bed}. The test bed has two different network configurations: Spatial Mode, and Random Mode. Under different network configurations, the CBLA system is expected to behave differently. We hypothesize that users would find activations closer to them more relevant, and hence more interesting. Therefore, a metric to quantify this proximal activation is devised. The configuration with higher proximal activation is then used for subsequent user study described in \Cref{sec:user-study}.

\subsection{Set-up}\label{sec:multi-cluster-setup}

The multi-cluster test bed described in \Cref{sec:multi-cluster-test-bed} is used for this experiment. Since the goal of this experiment is to examine the behaviours of the CBLA system, the Prescripted Engine is not used in this experiment. In addition, within the CBLA Engine, a sigmoid function based idling function as described in \Cref{eqn:map_sigmoid} is used.

\subsection{Procedures}

The CBLA system first starts at a blank state without any preexisting exemplars or prediction models. It operates without any external interferences for five minutes or 300 seconds. After that an object is placed in front of the IR proximity sensor C3.F2.IR-S (referring to \Cref{fig:Spatial Global Mode}) for approximately 30 seconds. Then, the object is removed and the experiment continues on for another 2 minutes or 120 seconds before the program is terminated.

This procedure was repeated three times for both Spatial Mode and Random Mode.

\subsection{Expected Results}

The level of output by an actuator is referred to as activation. All clusters are expected to have approximately the same level of activations during the initial learning period. After that, the amount of activations would reduce as the knowledge gain potential decreases. 

For Spatial Mode, it is expected that the activation as a result of the trigger at 300s point should be concentrated around the source which is Cluster 3 ($C3$). On the other hand, for Random Mode, since Nodes are connected randomly, activation should be more spread out and no one cluster should have a larger than average level of activation. To quantify the activation level, metrics that evaluate the average total activation and average cluster activation are devised.

The total activation level at time interval $t$ is the average output levels of all CBLA Nodes at time interval $t$. It can be calculated as followed.
 
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:total_activation}
	a_t = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{j=0}^{N} \overline{m_{jt}} \text{, for all Node $j$}
\end{equation}
where $a_t$ is the total activation level at time interval $t$; $N$ is the total number of CBLA Nodes; $\overline{m}_{jt}$ is the average output value of CBLA Node $j$ at time interval $t$.

We are interested in the total activation level during period immediately after the trigger was applied. Therefore, we compute the average total activation between the time of the trigger, $t_{trig}$, and the end of the readjustment period, $t_{readj}$, as followed.
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:average_total_activation}
\overline{a} = \frac{1}{| \left\{ a_{T_{trig}}, ... , a_{T_{readj}} \right\}|} \sum_{t=T_{trig}}^{T_{readj}} a_{t}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{a}$ is the average total activation from $T_{trig}$ to $T_{readj}$; and $| \left\{ a_{T_{trig}}, ..., a_{T_{readj}} \right\}|$ is the number of time intervals between $T_{trig}$ and $T_{readj}$.

By looking at the cluster activation level, we can determine if the activations are concentrated in any particular cluster. 
To find the cluster activation level, we apply \eqref{eqn:total_activation}, but only for the CBLA Nodes within a particular cluster.
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:cluster_activation}
	a_{ct} = \frac{1}{N_c} \sum_{j=0}^{N_c} \overline{m_{jt}} \text{, for all Node $j$ in cluster $c$}
\end{equation}
where $a_{ct}$ is the cluster activation level at time interval $t$; $N_c$ is the total number of CBLA Nodes in cluster $c$; $\overline{m}_{jt}$ is the average output value of CBLA Node $j$ at time interval $t$.

Similarly, we can calculate the average cluster activation level during the period between $t_{trig}$ and $t_{readj}$ as followed.
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:average_cluster_activation}
\overline{a_c} = \frac{1}{| \left\{ a_{cT_{trig}}, ... , a_{cT_{readj}} \right\}|} \sum_{t=T_{trig}}^{T_{readj}} a_{ct}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{a_c}$ is the average cluster activation from $T_{trig}$ to $T_{readj}$; and $| \left\{ a_{cT_{trig}}, ..., a_{cT_{readj}} \right\}|$ is the number of time intervals between $T_{trig}$ and $T_{readj}$.

In this experiment, we set $T_{readj}$ to 360s. This means that we are looking at the behaviours of the system within 60 seconds since the trigger at $T_{trig}$ = 300s.

\subsection{Results}

The average total activation and average cluster activation values for the Spatial and Random Mode trials are listed in \Cref{table:multi-cluster-results-spatial,table:multi-cluster-results-random}. The means of the results from the each set of the three trials were used to interpret the results.

For both Spatial mode (Trial 1, 2, and 3) and Random Mode (Trial 4, 5, and 6), their average total activation values, $\overline{a}$, were similar. It shows that the overall intensities of their activation levels are similar. However, the variance is much greater for Random Mode. The level of variation may be attributed to the fact that the links connecting its CBLA Nodes were different at every trial.

On the other hand, for Spatial Mode, the average cluster activation values for Cluster 3 is larger than the other clusters. Cluster 3 is where the trigger took place in the experiment. While for Random Mode, the values of different clusters are relatively consistent. This shows that activations do tend to concentrate more around the origin of the trigger in Spatial Mode in contrast to Random Mode as we expected. 

The total activation and the cluster activations over time plots for Trial~2 (Spatial Mode) are shown in \Cref{fig:multi-cluster-results-spatial-2}. At the point at $t$ = 300s when the an object was presented in front of a sensor at in Cluster~3, the activation level at the cluster (red) shot up and the activation levels in the other three clusters trail after as we expected. Furthermore, it is interesting to point out that the magnitudes of activations for the other clusters are actually similar or even higher than Cluster 3. This means that CBLA Nodes in a cluster would respond to an event happening in a neighbouring cluster with similar level of intensity while the timing may be delayed.

	\label{fig:multi-cluster-results-spatial-2}
\end{figure}

In contrast, in the total activation and the cluster activations over time plots for Trial~5 (Random Mode) shown in \Cref{fig:multi-cluster-results-random-2}, the activation levels across different clusters are relatively even and without much delays. This is also expected since the CBLA Nodes are linked randomly, there is no expectation that CBLA Nodes in one cluster should activate earlier than another.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussions}

In this experiment, we showed that the activations in response to a triggering event is more likely to begin and concentrate near the source of the trigger when the network is configured as Spatial Mode. Since we hypothesize that the users would find activations in close proximity to be more relevant and interesting, Spatial Mode seems to be a more promising network configuration. Therefore, in the User Study described in \Cref{sec:user-study}, the CBLA system would be configured in Spatial Mode. 

Another observation made in the experiment was that there seems to be some periodic spontaneous activations for either network configuration. For example, in both \Cref{fig:multi-cluster-results-spatial-2,fig:multi-cluster-results-random-2}, there were activation at around 100s to 200s points, even though there was not any external interferences. In fact, over a longer period of time, a self activation pattern becomes evident as shown in \Cref{fig:multi-cluster experiment cyclic activation} where the system was run in Spatial mode for 4500s uninterrupted. The CBLA Nodes activated spontaneously at a relatively consistent rate despite the absence of any external triggering events. 

\begin{figure} [!htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{"fig/validations/multi-cluster experiment cyclic activation"}
	\caption[Periodic spontaneous activation over a period of 4500s]{The CBLA system was running uninterrupted for 4500s in Spatial Mode. Even without any external events, the CBLA Nodes activated at a relatively consistent rate.}
	\label{fig:multi-cluster experiment cyclic activation}
\end{figure}

As mentioned in \Cref{sec:action_selection}, this periodic activation pattern is caused by the way which the relative action value, $\widehat{q^2_z}$, is calculated. Looking back at 
\Cref{eqn:relative_action_val}, \[\widehat{q^2_z} = \frac{q_t^2}{max(\overline{q^2_z}, \nu)}\] we can see that when the average squared action value, $\overline{q^2_z}$, hovers close to 0 for a long time, relative action value, $\widehat{q^2_z}$, would become very large. Fundamentally, this pattern is caused by the system's sensitivity to ambient sensor noise and can be adjusted by changing the sensitivity constant, $\nu$. Although setting $\nu$ to a larger value can eliminate this periodic activation pattern, it would also make the sculpture less responsive to the users and to the external environment. In addition, we believe that this kind of patterns can indeed be an interesting aspect of the behaviours of this interactive art sculpture. 


\section{User Study}\label{sec:user-study}

The CBLA system described thus far used on interactive art sculptures to automatically generate interactive behaviours. This user study aims to determine whether the behaviours generated through this method can make the experience of interacting with the sculptures more interesting, compared with prescripted behaviours. Simply put, we would like to test whether behaviours generated using the CBLA are more interesting than prescripted behaviours designed by human experts. The test subjects report their level of interest at several points in time as they interact with sculpture, with the two versions of behaviours. Afterwards, a short survey is given to assess the subjects' overall experience. The results of this study enables designers to design more engaging and interesting interactive art sculptures. 

\subsection{Objectives}\label{sec:user-study-objectives}

This study aims to examine the users' responses to the behaviour emerged from the CBLA system in an interact art sculpture. In addition, we aim to reveal the relationships between the intensity and type of activation and users' level of interest as they interact with the sculpture.

\subsubsection{Research Questions}

The objectives can be summed up in the following three questions.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Does the use of the CBLA increase user's interest level over prescripted behaviours?\label{itm:research-q1}
	\item Do people perceive CBLA as non-random?\label{itm:research-q2}
	\item Are certain behaviours  more interesting than others?\label{itm:research-q3}
\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Hypotheses}

Prior to the user study, an hypothesis was made for each of the research questions raised.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The CBLA works by continuously generating new behaviours in order to improve its internal mathematical model of the sculpture and its sensed environment. The behaviours are adaptive and analogous to how animals and human beings learn. It is hypothesized that the user will find this kind of behaviour more interesting than pre-programmed behaviours.
	\item Although the CBLA continuously generates new behaviours, it is not random. We hypothesize that the users will not perceive the CBLA-generated behaviours as random. 
	\item We hypothesize that users will categorize some types of behaviours as being more interesting than others. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Set-up}

The multi-cluster test bed described in \Cref{sec:multi-cluster-test-bed} was used in this user study at the interactive art sculpture that the participants would interact with. In addition, the floor is lined with a grid numbered from 1 to 12 as shown in \Cref{fig:cbla-test-bed gird photo}. This grid allows the participants to specify their locations within the sculpture.  

\begin{figure} [!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{"fig/validations/cbla-test-bed gird photo"}
	\caption[Photograph of the floor grid underneath the multi-cluster test bed]{Photograph of the floor grid underneath the multi-cluster test bed.}
	\label{fig:cbla-test-bed gird photo}
\end{figure}

In addition, a screen is set up next to sculpture to display a number. This number indicates the sample number. A laptop running the software is set up facing away from the sculpture beside the screen. 


\subsection{Recruitment}

Participants are recruited from the researchers' contact lists. All participants are healthy, physically able and seeing adults within the age range of 18 to 65 years old, male and female. Potential participants who are blind are excluded because they will be unable to perceive many of the behaviours, which are visually-manifested. Potential participants who are wheelchair users are excluded because they will not be able to access the studio, which has no elevator access.

In addition, participants should have little prior knowledge about that the workings of the CBLA system to avoid the subject-expectancy effect. This is a form of bias in which the test subject expects a particular result and this unconsciously affects the outcome. 

\subsection{Procedures}\label{sec:user-study-procedure}

Each participant is told the same information about the procedure of this user study. Only one participant would interact with the sculpture at any one time. 

\subsubsection{Before the Trial}

The test participant is invited to interact with an interactive art sculpture installed in the Toronto studio of Philip Beesley Architect Inc. (PBAI). This sculpture is the multi-cluster test bed described in \Cref{sec:multi-cluster-test-bed}. The participant is then informed about the procedures of the study and be asked to sign the consent forms in \Cref{Append:User Study Materials info-form} before they are allowed to participate in the study. 

After that, each participant will be given a pen and an envelope of a stack of 8 identical business-card-sized questionnaires as shown in \Cref{fig:Questionaire-Card2}. He or she is asked fill out one card every time a long tone is heard. The first question asks the subject to write down the current sample number as shown on the screen. The second asks for the subject's subjective interest level regarding the behaviour of the sculpture at that moment. The third question asks the subject to mark his or her location at that moment by looking down on to the grid on the floor. The subject is told to make a mark between boxes if he or she is standing in between those boxes. 

\begin{figure} [!htb]
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[height=0.55\textheight]{"fig/validations/Questionaire-Card2"}}
	\caption[Questionnaire card for the user study]{Questionnaire card for the user study.}
	\label{fig:Questionaire-Card2}
\end{figure}

Prior to the start of the trial, the researcher runs through the study procedures with the participant one last time. The participant is told that he or she is free to walk around the space and interact with the art sculpture in any way and there is not any prescribed interaction. The subject is also told that the entire trial would last for 20 minutes and he or she may request to terminate the study at any time.


\subsubsection{During the trial}

The test participant is free to roam around the space and interact with the art sculpture. A distinct long tone will go off periodically at a 2.5 minutes interval. When the tone goes off, the participant takes out an empty questionnaire card, and answer the questions on the card. The experiment will go on for 20 minutes which is equivalent to 8 cards.

There are two versions of interactive behaviours: a Prescripted Mode and a CBLA version. The Prescripted Mode is powered by the Prescripted Engine and is described in \Cref{sec:prescripted-behaviours}. The CBLA version, powered by the CBLA Engine and its mechanics is described in detail in \Cref{chap:cbla}. The participants will not be informed about which version of the behaviours they were interacting with nor the fact that there are two different version of the interactive behaviours. Both versions of the behaviours would be run for approximately the same amount of time. After the fourth tone (which is half-way through the trial), the researcher would switch to the other version manually after the participant has finished filling in the questionnaire card and resume interacting with the sculpture. 

Since the experience of interacting with the sculpture is new to the test subjects, the order which the two types of behaviours is presented can make a big difference. The subjects may simply find the novelty of interacting with the sculpture interesting irrespective of the type of behaviour. In addition, since the exit questionnaires are given after the trials, the behaviours that the subjects experience near the end of the trials may have more profound effects than the experience earlier in the trials. Therefore, half of the participants would be exposed to the prescripted version first and the other half would be exposed to the CBLA version first.

\subsubsection{After the trial}

After the eighth tone, the participant would be informed that the trial has been completed. He or she is then asked to return the questionnaire cards in the envelope given to him or her prior to the trial. The participant is the asked to fill out an exit questionnaire in \Cref{Append:User Study Materials exit-survey}. There were five questions on the questionnaire. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How interesting was your overall experience while interacting with the art 
	sculpture? \label{itm:survey-q1}
	\item How responsive was the sculpture to your presence?  Do you think its behaviour was totally random, or do you think it was responding directly to you? \label{itm:survey-q2}
	\item How familiar are you with machine learning algorithms? \label{itm:survey-q3}
	\item How would you describe the behaviour of the sculpture? \label{itm:survey-q4}
	\item Additional comments \label{itm:survey-q5}
\end{enumerate}

Question~\ref{itm:survey-q1} aims to elicit the participant's general opinion about how interesting it is interacting with the sculpture. Question~\ref{itm:survey-q2} aims to provide insights on research question~\ref{itm:research-q2}. Both questions~\ref{itm:survey-q1}~and~\ref{itm:survey-q2} are rated from a scale of 0 to 9. Question~\ref{itm:survey-q3} allows us to gauge whether or not the participant's prior exposure to machine learning has any effect of his or her perceptions of the behaviours of sculpture and it is rated on a scale of 0 to 4. Questions~\ref{itm:survey-q4}~and~\ref{itm:survey-q5} are open-ended questions that can give us qualitative information about the participant's experience that we might not be able to capture in our quantitative analyses. 


After that, the test participant is provided with a debriefing letter in \Cref{Append:User Study Materials debriefing}, which has more information about the learning algorithm, the interactive behaviours, and the purpose of this study. In addition, the interactive behaviours that he or she has interacted with are explained verbally after all questionnaires are collected.

\subsection{Results and Data}

A total of 10 trials were run. There were three main sets of data collected in each trial: the set of 8 questionnaire cards, the exit questionnaire, and the states of the CBLA system during the entire trial.

The questionnaire cards record each subject's levels of interest and locations at the 8 sample points. The levels of interest data allow us to compute the subject's overall interest level for each of the two segments, Prescripted Mode and CBLA Mode. We further separate the data into two groups based on either the trial started with Prescripted first or CBLA first and the data is shown in \Cref{table:user-study-cards-results-prescripted-first,table:user-study-cards-results-cbla-first}. On the other hand, the locations data allow us to examine the relationship between the level of activation near the test subjects to his or her reported interest level.

In addition, The input, output, and internal variables of the CBLA Nodes and non-CBLA Nodes during the entire trial were collection. The activation level of each CBLA Node was extract at 1.0s time interval for analyses on the correlation between activation levels and interest levels. 

Lastly, the exit questionnaires were given to the test subjects after the trials but before revealing any additional information about the user study. In addition, observations of the participants' behaviours and interesting comments made during verbal conversations with were noted.

\subsection{Analysis~\Roman{analysis-id} -- Average Interest Levels between Prescripted Mode and CBLA Mode} \label{sec:user-study-analysis-interest}
\stepcounter{analysis-id}

We first separated the levels of interest data samples that we collected from the questionnaire cards (\Cref{table:user-study-cards-results-prescripted-first,table:user-study-cards-results-cbla-first}) into four groups: Prescripted Mode (first half),  Prescripted Mode (second half),  CBLA Mode (first half), and CBLA Mode (second half). The ``Prescripted Mode'' or ``CBLA Mode'' indicates the version of the behaviours that was running when the level of interest was recorded, and ``(first half)'' or ``(second half)'' indicates whether the sample was taken during the first half or second half of the trial. We then take the average across all trials for each sample and we get four set of data with five elements each.

\begin{tabular}{l l}
	Prescripted Mode (first half):      &(4.75, 2.5, 4.5, 6.25, 7.5) \\
	Prescripted Mode (second half):     &(7.0, 4.75, 5.0, 6.25, 7.0) \\
	CBLA Mode (first half):             &(6.75, 4.5, 1.5, 4.0, 5.75) \\
	CBLA Mode (second half):            &(6.0, 3.25, 3.75, 5.625, 3.25)	
\end{tabular}

We then perform Welch's T-Test for unequal variance on different combinations of these four sets of data. For each test, the two-tails P-value must be below 0.1 in order for the null hypothesis (H0) to be reject in favour of the alternate hypothesis (H1).

Out of the six Welch's T-Test, only Test~\ref{itm:w-ttest-cbla-2nd}, which compares the level of interest between CBLA Mode and Prescripted Mode when they are on during second half of the trial, is able to reject the null hypothesis with a two-tailed P-value of 0.0684. Since the mean of the interest level of Prescripted Mode and CBLA Mode are 6.0 and 4.375 respectively. We can interpret that Prescripted Mode is more interesting than CBLA mode by approximately 37\% when it is on during the second segment with 96.58\% confidence. 

Furthermore, we are interested in finding out if a participant find Prescripted Mode more or less interesting than CBLA Mode. Since each participant has seen both versions of behaviours, we can compare their responses by performing Paired T-Tests. 

We first compare the each test subject's average levels of interests in CBLA Mode and Prescripted Mode, irrespective of which halves such behaviour was presented. 
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
 	\item CBLA Mode vs Prescripted Mode

 			\item[--- H0.] Participants find that CBLA Mode is equally as interesting as Prescripted Mode.
 			\item[--- H1.] Participants find that CBLA Mode is not equally as interesting as the Prescripted Mode.
 		\end{itemize}
 	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

In Test~\ref{itm:paired-ttest-both-halves}, we find that CBLA Mode is in fact less interesting than Prescripted Mode with 96.16\% confidence. For an average participant who has interacted with both kinds of behaviours, he or she gives Prescripted Mode a rate of 5.55 and a CBLA Mode a rate of 4.44. This means that Prescripted mode approximately 25\% more interesting than CBLA Mode irrespective of the order that they were presented. 

Taking a closer look, we want to see if the orders of which of the two versions is presented to the test subjects make a difference.

		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

In Test~\ref{itm:paired-ttest-first-half}, we could not find any significance that a participant would find CBLA Mode more or less interesting than Prescripted Mode when Prescripted Mode is on first. On the other hand, in Test~\ref{itm:paired-ttest-second-half}, we found that CBLA Mode is rated lower at an average of 4.5 compared to Prescripted Mode at an average of 6.0 with a 96.32\% confidence. This translates to a 33\% increase in interest level when the behaviour is switched from CBLA Mode to Prescripted Mode. This is quite surprising as we have always expected the initial curiosity of the participants would get boost the interest level of the behaviour presented first. However, this is not the case since the level of interest of Prescripted Mode should be even higher when it was presented first in the trial.


\subsection{Analysis~\Roman{analysis-id} -- Correlations between Activation level and Interest Level} \label{sec:user-study-analysis-activations}
\stepcounter{analysis-id}

We want to determine if there are any correlations between the participants' reported level of interest to the activation levels of the sculpture. In this analysis, we do not consider which version of the behaviours was running at the sample point and focus on the actual activation levels of the sculpture.

The extracted activation levels for each CBLA Node are the output levels of each node averaged in 1.0s windows. For each trial, there are 8 sample points and they are the times when the participant fills out a questionnaire card and reported his or her level of interest and location. For each sample point, the time interval containing it and 30 time intervals (which translates to 30 seconds) preceding it are considered as activations related to the sample point.

There are two general ways to calculate activation. The first way is ``Average Sample Average Activation'',  $\overline{\overline{\alpha}}$. It is computed by taking the average of the output values in the 30 time intervals preceding and at the sample point and taking the average of that value across all the nodes under consideration as formulated in \eqref{eqn:bar_bar_alpha}.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bar_bar_alpha}
	\overline{\overline{\alpha}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N}\frac{1}{31}\sum_{t=t_{s-30}}^{t_{s}}\overline{m}_{jt}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\overline{\alpha}}$ is the average sample average activation level among all CBLA Nodes being considered; $N$ is the number of CBLA Nodes being considered; $t_s$ is the time interval that the sample point is in. $t_{s-30}$ is the time interval that is 30 time intervals before $t_s$; and $\overline{m}_{jt}$ is the output level of CBLA Node $j$ at time interval $t$. 

The second way is the ``Average Sample Peak Activation'', $\overline{\widehat{\alpha}}$. It is computed by taking the maximum output values in the 30 time intervals preceding and at the sample point and taking the average of that value across all the nodes under consideration as formulated in \eqref{eqn:bar_hat_alpha}.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bar_hat_alpha}
\overline{\widehat{\alpha}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N} \text{max}(\overline{m}_{jt_{s-30}}, ... , \overline{m}_{jt_{s}})
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\widehat{\alpha}}$ is the average sample peak activation level among all CBLA Nodes being considered; $N$ is the number of CBLA Nodes being considered; $\overline{m}_{jt_{s-30}}$ and $\overline{m}_{jt_s}$ are the output levels of the CBLA Node $j$ at time intervals $t_{s-30}$ and $t_s$ respectively.

Using those two metrics, we can examine if there is any correlations between interest level and different types of activation levels. One type of activation levels is the system wide activation which we compute the metrics among all CBLA Nodes. The other type is device type activation, which we compute the metrics among just Half-Fin Nodes, Light Nodes, or Reflex Nodes. 

In addition, proximity of the activation to the participant should also be considered. For this, we formulate a modified version of $\overline{\overline{\alpha}}$ and $\overline{\widehat{\alpha}}$ that are weighted by the inverse proximities of the Nodes to the participant. They are called ``Average Sample Proximal Average Activation'', $\overline{\overline{\rho}}$, and ``Average Sample Proximal Peak Activation'',  $\overline{\widehat{\rho}}$. The proximity is measured in relative distance unit as only the relative proximity among Nodes is being considered in this metrics. 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bar_bar_rho}
\overline{\overline{\rho}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N} \frac{1}{31 \cdot d_j} \sum_{t=t_{s-30}}^{t_{s}}\overline{m}_{jt}
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\overline{\rho}}$ is the average sample proximal average activation level among all CBLA Nodes being considered; $N$ is the number of CBLA Nodes being considered; $d_j$ is the relative distance between the CBLA Node $j$ and the subject; $t_s$ is the time interval that the sample point is in; $t_{s-30}$ is the time interval that is 30 time intervals before $t_s$; and $\overline{m}_{jt}$ is the output level of CBLA Node $j$ at time interval $t$. 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bar_hat_rho}
\overline{\widehat{\rho}} = \frac{d_j}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N} \frac{1}{d_j} \text{max}(\overline{m}_{jt_{s-30}}, ... , \overline{m}_{jt_{s}})
\end{equation}
where $\overline{\widehat{\rho}}$ is the average sample proximal peak activation level among all CBLA Nodes being considered; $N$ is the number of CBLA Nodes being considered; $d_j$ is the relative distance between the CBLA Node $j$ and the subject; $\overline{m}_{jt_{s-30}}$ and $\overline{m}_{jt_{s}}$ are the output levels of the CBLA Node $j$ at time intervals $t_{s-30}$ and $t_s$ respectively.

Since we are interested in the correlation between activation levels of the sculpture and the interest level of an average user, we combine the data for all 10 studies and compute metrics described above. We then compute the Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, between those metrics and the user's level of interest in \Cref{table:user-study-correlation-results}.

\begin{table}[!htb]

	\end{center}
	\label{table:user-study-correlation-results}
\end{table}

Over the whole system, there is a weak positive correlation between interest level and both average sample average activation levels $\overline{\overline{\alpha}_{all}}$ and average sample peak activation levels $\overline{\widehat{\alpha}_{all}}$ with over 99\% confidence.

For device type correlation, we find the highest correlations for Light Nodes when considering average sample average activation levels. On the other hand, the highest correlation is found for Half-Fin Nodes when considering peak sample peak activation levels. Interestingly, we did not find any significant correlation between the activation levels of Reflex Node to the user's interest level. 

The proximities of the activations do not increase the correlation. The correlation coefficients for average sample proximal average activation $\overline{\overline{\rho}_{all}}$ and average sample proximal peak activation $\overline{\widehat{\rho}_{all}}$ are rough the same as their system-wide counterparts. This might be attributed to the fact that the sculpture is relatively small. 

Although the overall correlations across all ten studies is relatively weak, there is large variations among different studies. For instance, the average total peak activations level $\overline{\widehat{\alpha}_{all}}$ for Study 10 shows strong correlation with the subject's interest level. It has a Pearson coefficient $r$ of 0.924443 with over 98\% confidence. On the other hand, the same metrics for Study 3 shows no significant correlation. The two cases are plotted in \Cref{fig:correlation-study-specific} for a visual side-by-side comparison.

\end{figure}

This shows that different people respond and interact very differently to the behaviour of the sculpture. For instance, some people might indeed be attracted by the activation and was engaged to interact with the sculpture, while some might be attracted to sculpture due to other reasons, such as the aesthetic of the design. More samples would be needed to further categorize different types of test subjects.

\subsection{Analysis~\Roman{analysis-id} -- Responsiveness}\label{sec:user-study-analysis-responsiveness}
\stepcounter{analysis-id}

In the exit questionnaire, we asked the participants to rate their overall interest level and how responsiveness they think the behaviour was. In \Cref{table:user-study-responsive-data}, responses for the two questions and the average interest level reported on the questionnaire cards were tabulated. All three rating were reported in a scale of 0 to 9.

	\end{center}
	\label{table:user-study-responsive-data}
\end{table}

The Pearson correlation coefficient, $r$, between responsiveness and overall interest level is 0.680 with over 96\% confidence. Similarly, the $r$ between responsiveness and the average interest level reported on the questionnaire cards is 0.572 with over 91\% confidence. This show that responsiveness of the behaviours does have a moderate positive correlation to how interesting they are to the users.

On the other hand, there is moderate discrepancy between the overall interest level and the average interest level reported on the questionnaire cards. Their Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.682 with over 97\% confidence. This shows that the participants' reported interest levels as they were interacting with the sculpture is different from the ones reported afterwards. This is probably because some people tend to put more emphasis on their more recent experience when answering the question in the exit questionnaire. In fact, we can see that if Prescripted Mode was on during the second half of the trials, the average responsiveness rating was 6.9 as opposed to 5.6 when CBLA Mode was on during the second half with confidence level over 89\%. It is expected the CBLA Mode should be less responsive than Prescripted Mode. Therefore, we can speculate that when subjects report on the their impressions of the responsiveness of the sculpture after the trial, they disproportionately emphasized on their most recent interaction.



\subsection{Discussions}

In this user study, we attempt to answer the three research questions raised in \Cref{sec:user-study-objectives}. 

First,  does the use of the CBLA increase user's interest level over prescripted behaviours?  In the analyses done in \Cref{sec:user-study-analysis-interest}, we showed that CBLA Mode was in fact less interesting than Prescripted Mode by 25\%. This effect is even more pronounced when the trial started with CBLA Mode first and switched to Prescripted Mode halfway. Prescripted Mode was on average 33\% more interesting that CBLA Mode. This is contrary to our hypothesis as we did not find any significant evident that the use of the CBLA increase the user's interest level. 

Second, do people perceive CBLA as non-random? It is more difficult to answer this question since we did not ask the participants to rate the sculpture's responsiveness for each types of behaviours. In fact, based on question~\ref{itm:survey-q4} of the exit questionnaire, most participants did not realize that there were two distinct sets of behaviours that were switched over midway. This wasn't asked since we couldn't reveal the type of behaviours that they should expect during the trial. However, we do find a positive correlation between interest level and responsiveness rating. Since CBLA Mode is considered less interesting, it shows that CBLA Mode is considered somewhat random. In addition, we speculated test subjects tends to emphasize on later half of the trial when answering the exit questionnaires. On that front, we also found that the responsiveness rating is lower when CBLA Mode was on in the second half. In addition, the written responses when the participants were asked to described the behaviours of the sculpture, they tend to describe the CBLA portion using words like as ``random'', ''totally random'', ``somewhat random'', or ``unresponsive''. This shows that the participants did think that CBLA Mode was indeed random. This is also contrary to our hypothesis that the participants can perceive the learning behaviours as non-random.

Finally, are certain behaviours more interesting than others? In the analysis done in \Cref{sec:user-study-analysis-activations}, we found that there is a weak positive correlation between the overall activation levels and the user's interest level. In other word, the participants found that more actuations is more interesting than fewer actuations. On the other hand, we did not find that any specific device has a significantly stronger positive correlation. Similarly, we did not find that proximity of the actuations play influences the user's level of interest either. This may be because the size of the sculpture is relatively small and the participants can easily see, hear, and walk to anywhere in the sculpture relatively quickly compared with the time needed to fill out the questionnaire cards. Again, we can show that activations do tend to increase user's level of interest but, contrary to our hypothesis, we could not find any particular category of behaviours that is more interesting than the other. 

However, these conclusions may only apply to this particular set-up under this particular set of procedures. For instance, we believe that over a long period of time, prescripted behaviour would become repetitive and less interesting. In this user study the participants were only interacting with the prescripted behaviours for 10 minutes and perhaps that is insufficient for them to realize that it's repetitive and lose interest. In fact, one participant thought it was responsive to sound and was making noise and was still trying to figure out its non-existent response to sound until the end. 

Moreover, set up of this interaction is also very different from typical set-up. Typically, this sculpture is either set up as an art exhibition in some kind of public space like department stores, office buildings, and museums. Visitors are free to enter or leave the space as they like. In cases of a permanent installation, the sculpture is placed in the background to some other daily activities. This is very different from a some what one-on-one, timed interactions that we tested in this user study. In addition, typically visitors would be accompanied with others and the effect of multiple occupants in the same space is not covered. 

In addition, this project is motivated by the desire to generate life-like behaviours automatically. We don't know if being life-like is interesting to all people. In fact, from the informal conversations after the studies, we realized that people have very different expectations about the behaviours of the sculpture and interests. Some expected much more coordinated, fast-pace movement, while some found the much slower and organic looking movements interesting. Some expected the sculpture to be very responsive, while some did not even know that there were sensors that can detect their presence at first. Some participants take figuring out the exact mechanism of sculpture's behaviours as challenge; some were enjoying it and some were frustrated by their abilities to figure out the patterns. Moreover, there are also participants who enjoyed looking at the design of the sculpture and some are interested in the design of the circuit boards and actuators. They spent a great deal of time examining the details of the sculpture itself rather than interacting with the sculpture.

Furthermore, the ways how the participants interact with the sculpture vary greatly. Some mainly stood back and mainly observe, while some walked around the space rapidly and touching many parts of the sculpture at great frequency and perhaps randomly. In fact, one participant was taking apart the sculpture in order to better examine the part and how those alterations change the activation patterns of the sculpture. 

This shows that the data should be further categorized based on the type of users. Different people expect different things out of this experience, and analyzing the different groups separately may reveal more useful information about user's response to the different types of behaviours. In addition, the user study should be done in a more realistic setting over a longer period of time to reveal whether CBLA can indeed be more interesting in the long run.
