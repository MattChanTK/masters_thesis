abstract = {In hundreds of articles by experts from around the world, and in overviews and "road maps" prepared by the editor, The Handbook of Brain Theory and Neural Networks charts the immense progress made in recent years in many specific areas related to two great questions: How does the brain work? and How can we build intelligent machines? While many books have appeared on limited aspects of one subfield or another of brain theory and neural networks, the Handbook covers the entire sweep of topics—from detailed models of single neurons, analyses of a wide variety of biological neural networks, and connectionist studies of psychology and language, to mathematical analyses of a variety of abstract neural networks, and technological applications of adaptive, artificial neural networks. The excitement, and the frustration, of these topics is that they span such a broad range of disciplines including mathematics, statistical physics and chemistry, neurology and neurobiology, and computer science and electrical engineering as well as cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, and philosophy. Thus, much effort has gone into making the Handbook accessible to readers with varied backgrounds while still providing a clear view of much of the recent, specialized research in specific topics. The heart of the book, part III, comprises of 267 original articles by leaders in the various fields, arranged alphabetically by title. Parts I and II, written by the editor, are designed to help readers orient themselves to this vast range of material. Part I, Background, introduces several basic neural models, explains how the present study of brain theory and neural networks integrates brain theory, artificial intelligence, and cognitive psychology, and provides a tutorial on the concepts essential for understanding neural networks as dynamic, adaptive systems. Part II, Road Maps, provides entry into the many articles of part III through an introductory "Meta-Map" and twenty-three road maps, each of which tours all the Part III articles on the chosen theme.},

The proposed method adapts the ex- ploration parameter of $\epsilon$-greedy in dependence of the temporal-difference error observed from value-function backups, which is considered as a measure of the agent’s uncertainty about the environment. VDBE is evaluated on a multi-armed bandit task, which allows for insight into the behavior of the method. Preliminary results indicate that VDBE seems to be more parameter robust than commonly used ad hoc approaches such as $\epsilon$-greedy or softmax.},

abstract = {The ability to engage human observers is a key requirement for both social robots and the arts. In this paper, we propose an approach for adapting the Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity learning algorithm to distributed interactive sculptural systems. This Curiosity-Based Learning Algorithm (CBLA) allows the system to learn about its own mechanisms and its surroundings through self-experimentation and interaction. A novel formulation using multiple agents as learning subsets of the system that communicate through shared input variables enables us to scale to a much larger system with diverse types of sensors and actuators. Experiments on a prototype interactive sculpture demonstrate the exploratory patterns of the CBLA and collective learning behaviours through the integration of multiple learning agents.},

Robot deception is useful in conveying intentionality, and in making games against the robot more engaging. We study robot deception in goal-directed motion, in which the robot is concealing its actual goal. We present an analysis of deceptive motion, starting with how humans would deceive, moving to a mathematical model that enables the robot to autonomously generate deceptive motion, and ending with a study on the implications of deceptive motion for human-robot interactions.},

@inproceedings{Kompella2014,
abstract = {How can a humanoid robot autonomously learn and refine multiple sensorimotor skills as a byproduct of curiosity driven exploration, upon its high-dimensional unprocessed visual input? We present SKILLABILITY, which makes this possible. It combines the recently introduced Curiosity Driven Modular Incremental Slow Feature Analysis (Curious Dr. MISFA) with the well-known options framework. Curious Dr. MISFA's objective is to acquire abstractions as quickly as possible. These abstractions map high-dimensional pixel-level vision to a low-dimensional manifold. We find that each learnable abstraction augments the robot's state space (a set of poses) with new information about the environment, for example, when the robot is grasping a cup. The abstraction is a function on an image, called a slow feature, which can effectively discretize a high-dimensional visual sequence. For example, it maps the sequence of the robot watching its arm as it moves around, grasping randomly, then grasping a cup, and moving around some more while holding the cup, into a step function having two outputs: when the cup is or is not currently grasped. The new state space includes this grasped/not grasped information. Each abstraction is coupled with an option. The reward function for the option's policy (learned through Least Squares Policy Iteration) is high for transitions that produce a large change in the step-functionlike slow features. This corresponds to finding bottleneck states, which are known good subgoals for hierarchical reinforcement learning - in the example, the subgoal corresponds to grasping the cup. The final skill includes both the learned policy and the learned abstraction. SKILLABILITY makes our iCub the first humanoid robot to learn complex skills such as to topple or grasp an object, from raw high-dimensional video input, driven purely by its intrinsic motivations.},

abstract = {Most motion in robotics is purely functional, planned to achieve the goal and avoid collisions. Such motion is great in isolation, but collaboration affords a human who is watching the motion and making inferences about it, trying to coordinate with the robot to achieve the task. This paper analyzes the benefit of planning motion that explicitly enables the collaborator's inferences on the success of physical collaboration, as measured by both objective and subjective metrics. Results suggest that legible motion, planned to clearly express the robot's intent, leads to more fluent collaborations than predictable motion, planned to match the collaborator's expectations. Furthermore, purely functional motion can harm coordination, which negatively affects both task efficiency, as well as the participants' perception of the collaboration.},

@article{Gielniak2013,
abstract = {Action prediction and fluidity are a key elements of human-robot teamwork. If a robot’s actions are hard to understand, it can impede fluid HRI. Our goal is to im- prove the clarity of robot motion by making it more human- like. We present an algorithm that autonomously synthesizes human-like variants of an input motion. Our approach is a three stage pipeline. First we optimize motion with respect to spatio-temporal correspondence (STC), which emulates the coordinated effects of human joints that are connected by muscles. We present three experiments that validate that our STC optimization approach increases human-likeness and recognition accuracy for human social partners. Next in the pipeline, we avoid repetitive motion by adding variance, through exploiting redundant and underutilized spaces of the input motion, which creates multiple motions from a single input. In two experiments we validate that our variance approach maintains the human-likeness from the previous step, and that a social partner can still accurately recognize the motion’s intent. As a final step, we maintain the robot’s ability to interact with it’s world by providing it the ability to satisfy constraints. We provide experimental analysis of the effects of constraints on the synthesized human-like robot motion variants.},

@article{Oudeyer2007,
abstract = {Exploratory activities seem to be intrinsically rewarding for children and crucial for their cognitive development. Can a machine be endowed with such an intrinsic motivation system? This is the question we study in this paper, presenting a number of computational systems that try to capture this drive towards novel or curious situations. After discussing related research coming from developmental psychology, neuroscience, developmental robotics, and active learning, this paper presents the mechanism of Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity, an intrinsic motivation system which pushes a robot towards situations in which it maximizes its learning progress. This drive makes the robot focus on situations which are neither too predictable nor too unpredictable, thus permitting autonomous mental development. The complexity of the robot's activities autonomously increases and complex developmental sequences self-organize without being constructed in a supervised manner. Two experiments are presented illustrating the stage-like organization emerging with this mechanism. In one of them, a physical robot is placed on a baby play mat with objects that it can learn to manipulate. Experimental results show that the robot first spends time in situations which are easy to learn, then shifts its attention progressively to situations of increasing difficulty, avoiding situations in which nothing can be learned. Finally, these various results are discussed in relation to more complex forms of behavioral organization and data coming from developmental psychology},

It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone.

abstract = {Variations is an ongoing exploration of multi-channel and interactive music experienced through a sculptural interface. The interface functions as a means by which participants can create their own mix of the music by interacting with elements of a sculpture that consists of individual modules composed of a cube that contains a speaker, a tube and a removable ball that controls which channel of music they hear. Since one or more individuals may interact with the sculpture at any given time, there is an infinite variety of music that can be heard. This paper will discuss the evolution of the sculptural interface and the creative approach used in composing multi-channel and interactive music.},

@article{Ikegami2013,
abstract = {Living technology aims to help people expand their experiences in everyday life. The environment offers people ways to interact with it, which we call affordances. Living technology is a design for new affordances. When we experience something new, we remember it by the way we perceive and interact with it. Recent studies in neuroscience have led to the idea of a default mode network, which is a baseline activity of a brain system. The autonomy of artificial life must be understood as a sort of default mode that self-organizes its baseline activity, preparing for its external inputs and its interaction with humans. I thus propose a method for creating a suitable default mode as a design principle for living technology. I built a machine called the mind time machine (MTM), which runs continuously for 10 h per day and receives visual data from its environment using 15 video cameras. The MTM receives and edits the video inputs while it self-organizes the momentary now. Its base program is a neural network that includes chaotic dynamics inside the system and a meta-network that consists of video feedback systems. Using this system as the hardware and a default mode network as a conceptual framework, I describe the system's autonomous behavior. Using the MTM as a testing ground, I propose a design principle for living technology.},

abstract = {Canada’s entry to the 12th International Architecture Exhibition, la Biennale di Venezia, offers a vision for a new generation of responsive architecture. The collaborative work conceived by Philip Beesley is an immersive, interactive architectural installation fitted with arrays of sensors and kinetic devices. Lightweight interlinking systems are interwoven with next-generation chemistry that supports exchanges within the environment, in pursuit of an environment that ‘cares.’ The book contains essays by theorists and designers, extended photography, and detailed design documents of the evolving project.

abstract = {This paper presents the mechanism of Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity. This is an intrinsic motivation system which pushes the robot towards situations in which it maximizes its learning progress. It makes the robot focus on situations which are neither too predictable nor too unpredictable. This mechanism is a source of autonomous mental development for the robot: the complexity of its activities autonomously increases and a developmental sequence appears without be- ing manually constructed. We test this motivation system on a real robot which evolves on a baby playmat with objects that it can learn to manipulate. We show that it first spends time in situations which are easy to learn, then shifts progressively its attention to situations of increasing difficulty, avoiding sit- uations in which nothing can be learnt.},
